	<p> Hello! My name is Lauryn and I love books. I am currently a senior at UW-Madison majoring in political science and communications. Why didn't I major in English if I like books so much? Honestly, I don't know! My decision probably came from the idea that I should chose a major with which I can get a good job and whatever but I should have majored in English...and poli sci because I love that degree.
		I plan on getting my masters in Library and Information Science after taking a year or two off to save some money and read a lot of books. I'm excited to be a librarian though because I will be able to work with people and reccommend some great reads, which is also what I'm doing on this website!
		If I had an actual group of people that was interested in me, I imagine I would include a "frequently asked questions" section, but since I do not, I will anticipate your questions and include some (fake) FAQ's here! </p>

	<h1>FAQ's</h1>
	<article>
	<p> <b>What is your favorite book? </b></p>
		<p> Great question! My favorite book is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I also really like The House on the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune and Writers and Lovers by Lily King.
	<p> <b>What is your least favorite book? </b></p>
		<p> Also a great question! I really disliked The Hating Game by Sally Thorne and Death in Her Hands by Ottessa Moshfegh. </p>
	<p><b>Why are you qualified to give book reviews? </b></p>
		<p> I'm not really sure I am! But they're fun and I read more books than the average person so that's something. </p>
	<p><b>Ideal reading scenario? </b></p>
		<p> Comfy chair (preferrably pink or something fun), cat on lap, fireplace nearby, iced coffee on the table next to me, big chunky blanket over me and the kitty. </p>
